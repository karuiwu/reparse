COMPILATION ISSUES:

When compiling MegaM, I ran into issues trying to make. 
It couldn't find some flag -lstr

So basically, I found this link:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13584629/ocaml-compile-error-usr-bin-ld-cannot-find-lstr

... and then I made a change to my Ocaml libraries.


Here is the fix, copy-pasted from the website:
locate libcamlstr
cd /usr/lib/ocaml
sudo ln -s libcamlstr.a libstr.a
cd /usr/local/src/cil
make clean && ./configure && make
