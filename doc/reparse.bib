This is a bibtex file.  It contains bibliography information.

Any lines between citations are considered to be comments.

Each citation begins with a label stating what type of reference it is, followed
by the name that is used to cite that reference in the text.  Here, we say that
the thing we're citing is an article, and we give it the tag ``noFreeLunch.''

Note that some of the fields we fill in don't actually show up in the
bibliography that gets produced; this is controlled by the bibliography style.
We chose ``plain,'' which doesn't print things like the abstract and keywords.

You can have as many references as you want in a bibtex file; only the ones that
are actually cited in a paper will show up in that paper's references.
Therefore, you can use the same bibtex file for lots of papers, and simply have
all the references for all of them in one place.  This also means you don't have
to keep track of what things you did or didn't cite in a given paper; latex and
bibtex will automatically figure out what things you tried to cite, and include
them if they exist, or give warnings if they don't.
