\section{Introduction}

%\item What dependency parsing is. Its a way to parse sentences to construct dependency trees.
There is a weakness to dependency parsing, because the action of taking additional children is in effect stateless. In other words, only a comparison of the top word in the stack is made with the top word in the buffer before a parsing decision is made, and this could lead to incorrect parses such as where Verbs have taken multiple subjects. Although Dependency parsers come with children features to approximate a solution to this (such as having a feature for the first or last child for example), this is not the same as knowing exactly which children have been attatched. 

% having head automata be in particular states when certain children have and have not been accepted.

\section{Link Grammars}
A link grammmar can form undirected edge connections between two constituents. 
It is projective, so that there are no crossing edges.


\section{Link Grammar Parsing}

We parse from left to right, using a stack and a buffer similar to Shift Reduce Parsing or Arc Eager Dependency Parsing. 
Although a bottom-up parse would also be possible, such as in CKY.

{\bf Headings}: Type and label section and subsection headings in the
style shown on the present document.  Use numbered sections (Arabic
numerals) in order to facilitate cross references. Number subsections
with the section number and the subsection number separated by a dot,
in Arabic numerals. Do not number subsubsections.

{\bf Citations}: Citations within the text appear
in parentheses as~\cite{Gusfield:97} or, if the author's name appears in
the text itself, as Gusfield~\shortcite{Gusfield:97}. 
Append lowercase letters to the year in cases of ambiguity.  
Treat double authors as in~\cite{Aho:72}, but write as in~\cite{Chandra:81} when more than two authors are involved. Collapse multiple citations as in~\cite{Gusfield:97,Aho:72}. Also refrain from using full citations as sentence constituents. We suggest that instead of
\begin{quote}
  ``\cite{Gusfield:97} showed that ...''
\end{quote}
you use
\begin{quote}
``Gusfield \shortcite{Gusfield:97}   showed that ...''
\end{quote}

If you are using the provided \LaTeX{} and Bib\TeX{} style files, you
can use the command \verb|\newcite| to get ``author (year)'' citations.



\subsection{Graphics}

{\bf Illustrations}: Place figures, tables, and photographs in the
paper near where they are first discussed, rather than at the end, if
possible.  Wide illustrations may run across both columns.  Color
illustrations are discouraged, unless you have verified that  
they will be understandable when printed in black ink.

{\bf Captions}: Provide a caption for every illustration; number each one
sequentially in the form:  ``Figure 1. Caption of the Figure.'' ``Table 1.
Caption of the Table.''  Type the captions of the figures and 
tables below the body, using 11 point text.
